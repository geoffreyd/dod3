Views or Field Separation

Views
Pro
- standard implementation

Con
- Need to save views in code
- Need to rebuild index if view changes
- Need to callback to run index on every update or insert


Separation
Pro
- Easy search of any data
- 

Cons
- can't search using a hash
- need to parse data more and create more records
- could need many field definitions if an array had 200 elements  eg. tag_0, tag_1 etc
- need extra parameter to say if search is recursive
